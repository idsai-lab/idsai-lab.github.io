- paragraph: The Data Science Laboratory conducts research in machine learning, artificial
    intelligence, and its applications to large scale data domains in science and industry. This includes
    the development of deep generative models, methods for approximate inference, probabilistic programming,
    Bayesian deep learning, causal inference, reinforcement learning, graph neural networks, and geometric
    deep learning.

- paragraph: The main focus of our research is Automated Machine Learning (AutoML), which includes efficient
    hyperparameter optimization, neural architecture search, learning to learn, and meta-learning.

- paragraph: We also apply AutoML to improve practical deep learning for several applications of high societal importance.

- paragraph: While we discuss AutoML in detail on our project webpage AutoML, on this university website we provide
    information about our publications, teaching, projects, and how to get in touch to start working with
    us.
